                                I am currently a Teaching Assistant for an introductory Computer Science Course. This class covers teaching the fundamentals of the Python Language. My obligation for this course is to assist the professor during lectures with problems that may come up. I am also going to be helping to come up with assignments. Grading is another big part of this position too. We will be having students submit their code through an automatic grader for instant feedback. There will be code to make the automatic grader run. I will be working on that as well. This is one of the courses I am a tutor for as well, as outlined above.                               </p>

                                While at Ephrata National bank I was an intern on their IT Help Desk. One of my main projects was setting up yubikeys for the employeesâ€™ 
                                laptops as an extra layer of security. I also learned a lot about various other software having to do with banking, such as Bankway and 
                                Image Centre, so I could help employees with any problem they came in contact with. I also gained a lot of experience in how computers 
                                work and reimaging computers from viruses or refreshing computers for new employees. I also gained experience in setting up and fixing 
                                monitors, printers, and docking stations for employees as well. All the experience I gained was also done through a ticketing system, 
                                so I also have a lot of experience in documenting everything I do.

I am a tutor in a wide range of various Computer and Data Science courses. I can also tutor a lot of the lower math classes up to Calculus II and Discrete Mathematics, which is a logic and proof course. I help them better understand the content so that they perform better on exams, quizzes, and graded assignments.
