                      <h4 class="subtitle">May 2023 - July 2022</h5>
                        <p class="description">
                          One of the significant components of my research this summer was gathering diverse information
                          about the cyber hygiene of ships. One of my mentors, Brendan Dolan, was able to capture the
                          photo above while we were aboard a container ship. This information was collected to gain a
                          better understanding of how cyber security is practiced in the maritime industry. The gathered
                          data was utilized to develop a comprehensive cyber attack scenario targeting the USCG Sector
                          New York and its area of responsibility. The primary focus of the cyber security exercises,
                          scheduled for October 2023, is the facilities. However, it's also crucial for the Coast Guard
                          and the other ports in the harbor to recognize that the safety of a port is only as strong as
                          the security of the incoming vessels.
                          
                          My research and findings have contributed to a realistic cyber attack simulation that has led
                          to or is leading to a successful cyber security exercise. Virtually the entire USCG Sector New
                          York, along with the entire harbor area of New York up to Albany, NY, is benefiting from these
                          efforts. In addition to the research conducted to build the mock cyber attack scenario, I have
                          also developed a small website to promote cyber security awareness.

                          I am currently a Teaching Assistant for an introductory Computer Science Course. This class
                          covers teaching the fundamentals of the Python Language. My obligation for this course is to
                          assist the professor during lectures with problems that may come up. I am also going to be
                          helping to come up with assignments. Grading is another big part of this position too. We will
                          be having students submit their code through an automatic grader for instant feedback. There
                          will be code to make the automatic grader run. I will be working on that as well. This is one
                          of the courses I am a tutor for as well, as outlined above. </p>

                        <p class="description">
                          While at Ephrata National bank I was an intern on their IT Help Desk. One of my main projects
                          was setting up yubikeys for the employees’
                          laptops as an extra layer of security. I also learned a lot about various other software
                          having to do with banking, such as Bankway and
                          Image Centre, so I could help employees with any problem they came in contact with. I also
                          gained a lot of experience in how computers
                          work and reimaging computers from viruses or refreshing computers for new employees. I also
                          gained experience in setting up and fixing
                          monitors, printers, and docking stations for employees as well. All the experience I gained
                          was also done through a ticketing system,
                          so I also have a lot of experience in documenting everything I do.

                          and Academic Support can also be referred to as CCAS. I am a tutor in a wide range of various

                          Calculus II and Discrete Mathematics, which is a logic and proof course. I help them better
                          understand the content so that they perform better on exams, quizzes, and graded assignments.
