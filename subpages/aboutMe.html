  <h1> <center> Other Things About Caden </center> </h1>
  <h2>
    Growing up was not the easiest thing in the world. Being able to find ways to make life and tasks in life easier for myself
    and others is something I strive towards every day. The urge to figure things out and why it works motivates me and gives 
    me the passion to work with technology. Curiosity is believed to be a very fundamental virtue. The late Greek Philosopher 
    Socrates said as he was convicted and sentenced to death, “the unexamined life is not worth like for human beings,”. Under 
    the rigorous education of Eastern University’s Mathematical Science Department, I am preparing myself both in my studies and
    in my active involvement in both Campus life and Residential life,
    to make an impact on the world and leave it better than I found it. Here are a few others things that I have done or like to do that are not revealed in other parts of my website. Hover over each topic to see some more information.

        Eagle Scout is the highest rank that can be achieved in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) program. It is a prestigious honor that is achieved by only a small percentage of scouts. To earn the rank of Eagle Scout, a Scout must fulfill several requirements, including earning a minimum of 21 merit badges, serving in a leadership position within their troop, and completing a community service project that demonstrates leadership and teamwork.I earned my Eagle Scout Rank exactly, 15 days after my 16th Birthday.

          In High School, I was the team Manager for both the Women's and Men's Water Polo Teams. During the summer of 2020. It was not looking like parents would be allowed in the stands to watch their kids and grandkids play. I decided to teach myself how to live stream inorder for everyone to be able to watch the games. I also had to figure out how to get the best quality with the equipment I already had. I also used what I learned, to help out a few different churches and their live streams. Click down below to see a couple of my live streams.
