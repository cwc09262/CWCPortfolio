      I am Caden Coutz, currently enrolled as a juniors at Eastern University. My academic interests lie in the intersection of Computer Science and Data Science, which is why I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in both these fields. Additionally, I am also planning to obtain a minor in Mathematics to complement my major studies. This academic pursuit highlights my commitment to building a diverse skill set and preparing myself for a successful career in the tech industry.
      <br>
      Eastern University is a private, Christian university located in St. Davids, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded in 1952 and is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA. The university offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degree programs in fields such as business, education, nursing, psychology, and theology. It has a strong emphasis on experiential learning and service, and encourages students to get involved in mission trips and service projects both on and off campus. Eastern University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.
   <br>
      I am also a resident assistant at Eastern University, where I am able to use my skills and passions in building community and creating safe spaces for others to live in. I have a passion to help make their lives easier.

      <h2>
      During my time at Eastern,  I have taken Calculus 1 and 2, as well as Discrete Mathematics, which is a logic-based math course. I also took a course learning the Python programming language as well as another course in C++ with some Object Orienting skills as well. I have also taken an introductory course in Data Science, which was also taught in Python. 
      <br style="padding:10px;"> During the 2022-20233 academic year, I am going to be taking a Data Structures course taught in Java as well as Statistics for Data Science course. I will be a Teaching Assistant for an introductory Python course, as outlined in my Resume. In the Spring Semester, my intentions are to take a Databases Course, a 400 level Analysis of Algorithms Course, and an Operation Systems course. I am going to be taking another Data Science course and I will be learning R.  I plan to be a Teaching Assistant for another Computer Science course in the spring 2023 semester, as well. 
      <br>
      I am looking forward to having the chance to work alongside your company. I am passionate about my work and working alongside others to get projects done. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.
